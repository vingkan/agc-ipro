				<h1>About the Academy for Global Citizenship (AGC)</h1>
				<p>AGC is a K-8 charter school in Chicago, Illinois. As an international baccalaureate program, the school strives to develop the whole child. AGC approached students at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) with the STEM Education Innovation Challenge.</p>
				<center>
					<img class="spotlight" src="style/img/agc-wide-logo.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>This challenge tasked our team with creating creative STEM environments for students to learn in, while empowering AGC's dual English-Spanish community.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="problem">
				<h1>Framing the Problem</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>What factors are preventing parents from coming to AGC town hall meetings?</li>
					<li>How might we boost students' confidence in learning about STEM topics in a fun and engaging way?</li>
					<li>How can we offer activities suitable for a wide range of age groups and skill levels?</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="solution">
				<div class="photo-cover">
					<h1>The Solution</h1>
					<h2>Intellectual Playground</h2>
					<p>The Intellectual Playground is an event that AGC can hold at the same time as its town hall meetings, providing childcare for families that attend as well as offering a fun, hands-on STEM learning experience. Each Intellectual Playground kit comes with manipulatives, tools, and lesson plans that can be combined for many different activities that introduce students at different grade and skill levels to STEM concepts.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="solution-cont">
				<h1>Boosting STEM Confidence</h1>
				<p>While most activities are not equivalent to coursework, they are designed to make students comfortable enough with a topic that they would have the confidence to enroll and succeed in a course about later on.</p>
				<h1>Accessible for Others to Build On</h1>
				<p>The Intellectual Playground design process is meant to be accessible to educators and parents alike so that an active parents organization like AGC's could also step in to create and lead sessions throughout the year or at home.</p>

					<b><h1>Lessions We Learnt</h1></b>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<hr>
							<h2>1. Make Game More Attractive</h2> 

							This can be done by designing a new deck of cards, with colorful, attractive characters, or even have more funny topics. 
							<h2>2. Get Older Kids Involved </h2>
							This can not only help them preview the courses that they are about to take in the coming semester, like biology, but a way to let them work with younger students, like a "pair-up" after-class activity.
							<h2>3. Different Kinds of Activities </h2>
							The "Aliens Generation Factory" requires mentors to participate. Since the teacher and kids ratio is around 1:3 to 1:4, we might not have that many teachers who can stay that long at school with those kids.
