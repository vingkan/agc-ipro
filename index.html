				<h1>About the Academy for Global Citizenship (AGC)</h1>
				<p>AGC is a K-8 charter school in Chicago, Illinois. As an international baccalaureate program, the school strives to develop the whole child. AGC approached students at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) with the STEM Education Innovation Challenge.</p>
				<center>
					<img class="spotlight" src="style/img/agc-wide-logo.jpg">
				</center>
				<p>This challenge tasked our team with creating creative STEM environments for students to learn in, while empowering AGC's dual English-Spanish community.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="problem">
				<h1>Framing the Problem</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>What factors are preventing parents from coming to AGC town hall meetings?</li>
					<li>How might we boost students' confidence in learning about STEM topics in a fun and engaging way?</li>
					<li>How can we offer activities suitable for a wide range of age groups and skill levels?</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="solution">
				<div class="photo-cover">
					<h1>The Solution</h1>
					<h2>Intellectual Playground</h2>
					<p>The Intellectual Playground is an event that AGC can hold at the same time as its town hall meetings, providing childcare for families that attend as well as offering a fun, hands-on STEM learning experience. Each Intellectual Playground kit comes with manipulatives, tools, and lesson plans that can be combined for many different activities that introduce students at different grade and skill levels to STEM concepts.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="solution-cont">
				<h1>Boosting STEM Confidence</h1>
				<p>While most activities are not equivalent to coursework, they are designed to make students comfortable enough with a topic that they would have the confidence to enroll and succeed in a course about later on.</p>
				<h1>Accessible for Others to Build On</h1>
				<p>The Intellectual Playground design process is meant to be accessible to educators and parents alike so that an active parents organization like AGC's could also step in to create and lead sessions throughout the year or at home.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="micropilot">
				<h1>The Prototype</h1>
				<h2>The Alien Factory</h2>
				<p>Our team got to work with six AGC students on 11/25/2015 to test our example Intellectua Playground event: a series of games to teach concepts in genetics using aliens.</p>

					<p>Rosa has three kids: John, Ernesto Jr, and Beatrice.</p>
					<p>Rosa moved to Chicago from El Salvador 15 years ago, with her late husband Ernesto in hopes of becoming a licensed nurse.</p>
					<p>Widowed, Rosa works full time at a restaurant while going to night school.</p>
					<p>She wishes that she could take an active role in her children's school life, but feels there simply isn't enough time, or when there is time, she can't find affordable child care.</p>
					<p>One day, Rosa hears from Julia (mother of a friend of Beatrice's) about an event AGC is hosting, "Intellectual Playground"</p>
					<p>Julia tells Rosa that the event is a way for parents to get involved, and where the children can come as well.</p>
					<p>Rosa brings her children to the Intellectual Playground.</p>
					<p>As her children go into another room, Rosa realizes that this is the first time she has been to an event at the school.</p>
					<p>The night passes by and Rosa feels not only welcomed, but also as if her voice was heard. She feels, happy.</p>
					<p>Rosa picks up her children from the other room.</p>
					<p>John, Ernesto Jr, and Beatrice are each holding a mask, they drew them themselves, they're aliens!</p>
					<p>As the four walk back home, Emilia and John explain to their mom all about what they learned, Junior says he wants to become a doctor someday.</p>
					<p>Beatrice runs around with her mask on, screaming "I'm an alien! Blargh!"</p>
					<p>Rosa laughs. She is overcome with a blend of happiness, proudness, and accomplishment.</p>
					<p>That night, after tucking her children into bed, Rosa frames the children's masks and hangs them on the wall.</p>

					<h1>Lessons We Learnt</h1>
					<h2>1. Make Game More Attractive</h2> 
					<p>This can be done by designing a new deck of cards, with colorful, attractive characters, or even have more funny topics.</p>
					<h2>2. Get Older Kids Involved </h2>
					<p>This can not only help them preview the courses that they are about to take in the coming semester, like biology, but a way to let them work with younger students, like a "pair-up" after-class activity.</p>
					<h2>3. Different Kinds of Activities </h2>
					<p>The "Aliens Generation Factory" requires mentors to participate. Since the teacher and kids ratio is around 1:3 to 1:4, we might not have that many teachers who can stay that long at school with those kids.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="process">
				<h1>The Process</h1>
				<h2>How can I create my own Intellectual Playground event?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Choose a topic that lends itself to building things. Workshops have the most potential to engage students.</li>
					<li>List all of the complex terminology related to the topic and translate it to kid-friendly terms.</li>
					<li>Design manipulatives that would be versatile and fun to play with.</li>
					<li>Create lesson plans for starter, main, and review activities. Starters should be accessible to kindergarten students.</li>
